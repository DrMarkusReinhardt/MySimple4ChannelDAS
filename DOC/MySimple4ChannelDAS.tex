\section{Concept description}
A project to build-up a simple 4-channel low sample rate, high accuracy (16-bit ADC)
Data Acquisition System (DAS) to support general universal measurements.\\

The signals to be measured are fed to a 1:10 divider or via a 1:1 connection to the buffer amplifier of each channel.
The signals are then ADC converted by the 4 channel ADS1115 ADC on the ADC module.
The Arduino Uno is controlling the ADS1115 and receiving the digitized signals via the I2C interface.
The data is then sent to the PC via the SoftwareSerial port, a USB/Serial module using the CmdMessenger library to the PC.
On the PC a Python (PyQt) or C++ (Qt) program using also the (Py)CmdMessenger library is receiving, evaluating and displaying the data.

HW components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Arduino Uno
	\item USB/Serial module to connect the PC with the Uno via SoftwareSerial interface and USB connector.
	\item 4-Channel ADS1115 16-bit ADC module.
	\item 4-Channel 1x buffer amplifier board, LM324 based.
	\item 10x / 1x inputs and resistor divider.
	\item Simple plastic case
\end{itemize}

SW components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Arduino sketch to control the ADC module and send the data via the serial interface to the PC.
	\item C++ / Qt based software library to sample, store and evaluate data from up to 4 channels.
	\item PyQt based Python program running on the PC to receive and store data from up to 4 channels.
	\item First SW example: Tracing the charging characteristic (voltage and current) of a LiPo cell.
\end{itemize}
